https://swappy-fi.com

Swappy is a decentralized swap protocol built on Ethereum, Optimism, Arbitrum One, Polygon, and Binance Smart Chain. It allows users to create and manage token swap offers with flexible parameters. The project is open source and is built around two main smart contracts: `SwappyData` and `SwappyManager`.

## Features

- **Flexible Swap Offers**: Create swap offers with specific parameters including partial fills, expiration times, and destination addresses (for private swaps).
